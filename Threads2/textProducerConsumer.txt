Producer      1324186528 123123Consumer 123 Design  00000    pattern     is   123123a 0000003
classic concurrency or       threading pattern which reduces coupling between Producer and Consumer by separating 

Identification of work with Execution of          Work. In producer consumer design
 pattern, a shared queue is used to control the flow, and this 

separation allows 


you to code producer and consumer separately.                         It also addresses the issue of different timing require to                             produce item or consuming item. By using producer consumer pattern,              both Producer and Consumer Thread can work with 

different speed.
